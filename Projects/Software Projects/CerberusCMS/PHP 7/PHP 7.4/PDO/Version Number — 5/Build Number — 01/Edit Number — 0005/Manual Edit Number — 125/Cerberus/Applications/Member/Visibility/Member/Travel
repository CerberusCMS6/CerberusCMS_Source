<B>Notes</B>: <I>The backpacking items and the traveling items that are shown here are very high quality items that are at tiered price ranges between $1,000 United States Dollars to $3,500 United States Dollars total. These items will provide a very high quality luxury experience in any weather condition and the items will last long enough where individual items or all of the items collectively can be re-ordered to your current location if in the event any or all of the items are damaged, lost, switched-out, misplaced or stolen. Alternatively an entire duplicate of the backpacking items can be shipped out to your current location at any time.</I>

The jacket will never fall apart if it is correctly
crafted and it will last for up to 50 years. The jacket provides an extra layer of warmth in the colder months and it can be solely worn in hot weather conditions to shield the skin from the sun.

The Olukai &#8482; Sandals can be modified with extra-tough kevlar stitch threading re-inforcements to make the sandals last for up to 6 months with 7 - 10 miles per day of usage of walking in the sand without any risk of the foot developing any infections because the upper part of the sandal is a fabric material and it is not plastic. Therefore when the upper part of the sandal rubs against the top of the foot it will not degrade the skin or the muscle around the top or the sides of the foot. The shown QuickSilver / QuikSilver Sandals are made with a fabric upper and not plastic and with the correct modifications these specific sandals can be used to walk and run for up to 7 - 10 miles per day and they will last for up to 3 - 6 months before the rubber begins to grind thin.
The modifications require replacing the upper part of the sandal with a thicker fabric material and then by adding a thick rubber saucer to the bottom of the sandal and finally by looping through the fabric upper material into the rubber saucer. This modification will prevent the fabric material upper from ever breaking.<BR><BR>

The ShoeGoo &#8482; Goop mixed with a rubber cement and fire-proof goop can be applied to the sole of the boots to guarantee that the sole of the boot will never grind down in up to ~18 miles of walking per day for up to 30 days. The best pattern
of applying the ShoeGoo &#8482; Goop is to fully coat the bottom of the boot with one whole tube of ShoeGoo &#8482; Goop, then apply a rubber cement coating combined with the fire-proof goop and finally by applying a series of dot patterns with more ShoeGoo &#8482; Goop. The mix takes about 48 hours to completely dry.
This will make the boots entirely slip resistant in up to several inches of direct rainfall on just about any surface as well as fire-proof and acid resistant. The entire mix will need to be removed and re-applied every 30 days.<BR><BR>

<B>High Quality Rust-Proof Fixed Blade Knives With Blood-Drain, Hand-Rail, Hand-Guard and Kevlar / Paracord 750 / Stainless Steel Lanyard Cable Make For One of The Most Dangerous Knives In The World. Why ?</B><BR>
Because once the Paracord-550, the Paracord-750 or the Stainless Steel Metal Cable Lanyard Loop is securely fastened around the wrist the knife itself cannot be removed from the wrist or from the hand by an attacker if the fist is clenched and when anyone attempts to take the knife away they are instantly cut by the knife because they cannot actually take it away from the hand or the wrist if the knife fighter moves their arm and hand away. Experienced Knife Fighters and Knife Specialists usually double-knot a lanyard loop at just the right size where the Knife Specialist can put their hand through that lanyard hole where that lanyard double-knot cannot be tightened or loosened any further and where that Knife Specialist can then clench their fist to make it impossible for any attackers to remove the knife from the wrist if fighting more than 2 targets.<BR><BR>

When an attacker grabs for the knife they are always cut by the blade. It usually takes 3 or more people who are trained in knife disarming to take away a fixed blade lanyard loop knife from the trained knife fighter. First they would need to grab on to the wrist and the bicep of whoever has the fixed blade lanyard loop knife and then another person would need to hold them down on the ground while applying all of their collective body weight to the knife fighter and the wielding hand to prevent that knife fighter from moving his or her arm and to then cut the lanyard loop from the wrist to take away the knife, but if the lanyard is a certain gauge and thickness of flexible stainless steel it cannot ever be removed with hand-held wire cutters.<BR><BR>

Knife fighting with a lanyard loop is the best way to go because it cannot easily be removed from the hand or from the wrist therefore the only thing that the knife fighter with it can do is keep up with stabbing or cutting motions until the targets are dead. One can kill bears, wild animals, enemy human targets or any enemy with an automatic rifle or a hand-gun close range ( Within 20 feet ) without getting shot because the enemy with the rifle or the hand-gun cannot draw, aim and fire the firearm at the trained knife fighter fast enough before the trained knife fighter moves in and stabs the person holding the rifle or the hand-gun up to 100 times all over the body in ~90 seconds.<BR><BR>

Real world demonstrations have proven irrefutably that an enemy with a hand-gun or an automatic rifle cannot aim and shoot fast enough close range at someone with a fixed blade lanyard loop knife before that experienced knife fighter can stab that enemy human or that enemy animal up to 100 times all over the body in ~90 seconds. Some demonstrations and real-world scenarios have proven that a fixed blade lanyard loop knife fighter
can stab an enemy target that has a hand-gun or an automatic rifle up to 100 times in the neck, head, chest, arms, hands, stomach and legs in ~90 seconds. Fixed Blade Knives do not bend or break whereas kitchen knives are usually thin and break in half or are easily broken from the handle / hilt in repetitive stabbing and if that kitchen knife does not have a hand-guard the hand will almost always slip onto the sharp part of the blade where the hand will be cut and rendered useless.<BR><BR>

IF: the Fixed Blade Lanyard Loop Knife has a Hand-Guard you can be guaranteed that your hand will never slip onto the blade while using the knife to repeatedly stab and cut over and over again at different angles.
IF: the Fixed Blade Lanyard Loop Knife has a Blood-Drain the knife is guaranteed to not get stuck in the body of the enemy human or the animal after stabbing it. Usually a thin or thick blade will get stuck in the body of the target because the body is a vacuum and foreign objects will get stuck in it if penetrated, especially a knife if it does not have a blood-drain. Handling wild animals close range with a Fixed Blade Lanyard Knife is not difficult once practiced and different parts of the animals body can be cut and removed very quickly afterwards. One can also cut away and strip away all of the meat and the muscle off of the animal very quickly once the animal is dead. IF: the blade is thick enough one can be guaranteed to cut through hardened bone with ease. IF: the Fixed Blade Lanyard Loop Knife is close enough to the wrist the enemy targets cannot grab the arm to push your own arm and hand into your body to stab you with your own knife. Strong fixed Blade Lanyard Loop Knives can easily be concealed and they can fit in between the ribs on the chest or the side of a person where the blade can repeatedly stab internal organs and if sharp enough
all of the weight of the Knife Specialist can be used to pull the knife down to cut open the entire body of the target.<BR><BR>

Contrary to popular belief: Fixed Blade Lanyard Loop Knives are more dangerous than a kitchen knife or a meat cleaver because they don't bend and they don't break. The most dangerous knife in the world is known as
the Jagd-Kommando Knife and is capable of killing a human being in ~4 - ~5 minutes where when used on a target human being all of the blood within that target human being equalling approximately ~1.5 - ~1.6 gallons at ~13 - ~14 pounds of liquid weight drains entirely from that enemy target human body within the next ~2 minutes after receiving the knife wound(s) and that enemy target human body dies within the next ~2 minutes after entire body blood drain.<BR><BR>

<B>Training Instructions</B>: <I>Training with a Fixed Blade Lanyard Loop Knife usually requires approximately ~93 consecutive days or ~3 consecutive months. One must first learn how to travel safely with this knife stored in its original sheathe or another ultra secure sheathe where the knife will never pop out of that sheathe or cut the sheathe, how to quickly remove this knife from the wrist before running with it so as to prevent falling and stabbing the self with the knife, how to correctly tie the boot laces so that one does not trip on the boot laces that potentially become untied while knife fighting and while running if this knife is fastened around the wrist, how to throw this knife away from the body before jumping over fences and obstacles to make it impossible for this knife to stab the body while doing so, how to correctly dispose of this knife so that no one else can get it as well as hundreds if not more different close range knife safety scenarios. One must learn to fall forward with this knife without stabbing the self, fall backwards with this knife without stabbing the self, fall on the side with this knife without stabbing the self, how to use this knife on enemy targets while in the rain, while in the sand, while on concrete, while on blacktop, while on the street, while in a vehicle, while on a motorcycle as well as hundreds if not more different close range knife fighting scenarios</I>.<BR><BR>

IF: this knife is not removable by you from the wrist in a knife fight you will have a 100% chance of death. The knife lanyard loop must be correctly tied where the knife can be removable by you by quickly unclenching the fist and pulling the hand out of the lanyard loop, but not removable by an attacker while your fist is clenched and where that attacker cannot tighten the lanyard loop down any further onto your own wrist where you cannot take it off.</I><BR><BR>

<I>IF: this knife is fastened around the wrist and it is not removable and you run you have a 100% chance of death. With the correct training the knife fighter can kill up to 3 armed targets close range in ~7 minutes by stabbing each enemy human target up to ~100 times in the head, eyeballs, neck, shoulders, arms, forearms, hands, chest, stomach and legs. It usually takes around ~60 seconds to ~90 seconds for all ~1.5 gallons of blood to run out of the target neck if it is cut from ear to ear and if sharp enough the blade can penetrate through a human skull.</I><BR><BR>

With the correct care the shown Fixed-Blade Knives can be made to last for up to 180 days of every-day continuous use before requiring replacement and are comparable to if not better than the strength and the quality of U.S. Military Issue Knives that are meant for quickly killing targets for a fraction of the price.<BR><BR>

The shown stainless steel hand-guard attachment can be attached to this specific Fixed Blade Lanyard Loop Knife by removing the lanyard material or the lanyard flexible metal cable and then by inserting this stainless steel hand-guard onto this Fixed Blade Knife from either the hilt of this fixed blade knife or from the blade of this fixed blade knife. This specific Fixed Blade Lanyard Loop Knife must be re-wrapped correctly after attaching this stainless steel hand-guard attachment. The lanyard material or the lanyard flexible metal cable must be double wrapped on each end of this stainless steel hand-guard attachment so that when using this fixed blade knife the hand-guard attachment will not move in any angle of use and the hand will never slip onto the blade of this Fixed Blade Lanyard Loop Knife.<BR><BR>

In most U.S. States this knife can be carried out in the open in a community area with a population group if the knife is securely fastened in its accompanying sheathe and if the sheathe is securely looped through a belt or suspenders where the knife is visible by civilian law enforcement. But, remember: IF: this Fixed Blade Lanyard Loop Knife is worn on the belt or the suspenders and it is visible you risk the possibility of anyone walking up to you and removing the knife from the sheathe to take it away from you and kill you with it or steal it from you. IF: this specific Fixed Blade Lanyard Loop Knife is worn on the suspenders while the shirt is over the suspenders or if it is concealed within the pants: no one can walk up to you and take the knife away from you to kill you with it or steal it from you and with practice you can quickly remove this knife from the concealed area and slip the hand through the lanyard in order to use it within less than 2 seconds.<BR><BR>

In most U.S. States this knife cannot be legally classified as a Dirk or as a Daggar / Dagger type of knife because it does not have a built-in hand-guard and therefore it is completely legal to carry out in the open because it does not have a built-in hand-guard and the length of the blade is less than what is not legally allowed. Knives can only be legally classified as a Dirk or as a Daggar / Dagger type of knife by a judicial system and or by law enforcement if the knife has a built-in hand-guard and is of a length greater than what is legally allowed and is therefore illegal to carry in a community area with a human population group out in the open or concealed.<BR><BR>

This Fixed Blade Lanyard Loop Knife is legally classified as a survival tool and is also separately classified as a hanging tool by most U.S. State Law and by the U.S. Federal Law. Consult local lawyers and local U.S. civilian law enforcement in your area for more details about this specific knife as there is a 4-way separation of legal jurisdictions: U.S. Federal Law, U.S. State Law, U.S. Incorporated City Ordinance Law / U.S. Census-Designated-Place Ordinace Law, U.S. Municipal / U.S. Local Community Common Law. This knife is the best survival knife available for camping, traveling on foot in wilderness / woods / snow, for fishing, for opening sealed cans of food and for traveling on foot in community areas with a human population. Dirk and Daggar types of knives are illegal because they have built-in hand-guards or built-in pseudo hand-guards that are meant to prevent the hand from slipping onto the blade while using it to stab animals, enemy human targets and other things. Whereas with a Fixed Blade Lanyard Loop Knife the lanyard cable is meant to be used as a tool to prevent the hand from injury while cutting wood, cans of food as well as for other uses.<BR><BR>

In other words: The system will not do anything to protect you from being abducted and or killed. Law enforcement does not care about you and they will not lift a finger to help you against your enemies. Law enforcement is paid by the tax payers and the only thing that they will do is protect the areas, the businesses and the individuals that put money into their pockets, if at all. Law enforcement is a dirty business and law enforcement can charge you and process you for anything, anywhere and at any time including by walking into your house and charging you while you are completely naked in your own house for the reason of being naked in your own house because according to most U.S. State laws it is illegal to be naked anywhere. Laws are written non-specifically and usually only in writing so that the system can interpret those laws however they want and deliberately press everything against you for any reason at all whatsoever in order to get rid of you in whatever way that they want to.

The most dangerous knife in the world is classified as the Jagd-Kommando Knife, but has a different name in different countries and is capable of killing a 300 Pounds / 136.078 Kilo-Grams human being in approximately ~4 - ~5 minutes flat where when used on an enemy target all of the blood within the body of that enemy target that usually equals approximately ~1.5 - ~1.6 gallons of human blood and weighs approximately ~13 - ~14 pounds of liquid weight will drain entirely from that enemy target body in approximately ~2 minutes and the target body dies within the next ~2 minutes after all of the blood squirts out of the hole(s) that are left in that target body.<BR><BR>

The Jagd-Kommando knife is a twisted knife that puts a 7 - 12 inch deep hole in the body at a surface size of approximately x1 half-dollar U.S. coin if not greater in size depending on if it is custom made to be bigger. This knife can be stabbed / inserted into any point in the human body very easily including the skull. IF: this knife is stabbed / inserted into the chest at the correct angle all of the ~1.5 to ~1.6 gallons of blood of the target body will quickly squirt out of the hole in the body in approximately ~2 minutes. IF: the knife is stabbed / inserted into the bicep, the thigh, the hip, the stomach or the neck and the heart is unaffected: the heart will continue pumping as all of the ~1.5 - ~1.6 gallons of blood quickly squirt out of the holes that are left in the body. Imagine if shooting several .22 caliber bullets through a large 5 gallon plastic water jug filled with red colored water. What follows is that all of the red colored water slowly squirts out of all of the holes that are left in that 5 gallon plastic water jug. The knife wound is impossible close even if the target is taken to an emergency room immediately after receiving the wound or the multiple wounds. This knife is the most practical tool to use against multiple targets who weigh more than 180 Pounds / 81.6466 Kilo-Grams. This knife is also the most practical tool to use against a moving target close range where one can simply walk up to that target and use this tool to end their life within 5 minutes and walk away. Because of certain laws within the United States and supposedly the international laws and treaties of the Geneva Convention this knife cannot be shown in this web application software, but there are similar knives that are available for custom building / machining. The real version of this knife cannot be purchased. It must be custom made and it is used in real world
military campaign applications for quickly killing several targets and walking away to the next area.

The shown authentic M1911 or 1911 FireArm is made in the U.S.A. and remains one of the best commercially avaiable hand firearms available where hundreds of customizations can be made to this firearm. The barrel of the M1911 or 1911 is usually capable of ejecting a 9 Millimeter to 12 Millimeter round. Customizations can be made to convert the M1911 or 1911 into a 3 - 5 burst-shot or completely automatic. It can also be made to never jam.<BR><BR>

With correct care the shown authentic M1911 can be made to last for up to 180 days of every-day continuous use before requiring part replacements.

The shown authentic Atmova Kalashinokov / Atmovat Kalashinokova is made in Russia and remains one of the best automatic rifles that are commercially available where hundreds of customizations can be made to this firearm. This rifle almost never jams due to a gas rotating bolt that hits the ammunition. This specific rifle is completely water-proof due to the kind of metal and laminated wood that it is made out of and because a gas rotating bolt hits the ammunition it can be fired underwater. This rifle can be carried with several double-taped and triple-taped square or banana shaped magazines for an ultra fast 0 - 5 second reload. Triple-taped magazines for an authentic AK-47 can be made by taping two magazines together where each one is pointed in the opposite direction and then by taping the third magazine sideways at an angle.<BR><BR>

This specific rifle is usually the rifle of choice of small militias, small armies, cartels and drug cartels due to the extreme effectiveness and focus of the rifle whereas most guns and rifles that are manufactured in the United States after the 1970s regularly jam in long durations of fire due to the low quality parts that are used in those hand-guns and in those rifles.<BR><BR>

With correct care the shown AK-47 Automatic Rifle can be made to last for up to 180 days of every-day continuous use before requiring part replacements.

The Native &reg; &trade; Hair Conditioner, The Herbal Essence &reg; &trade; Hair Conditioner and the Tresemmé &reg; &trade; Hair Conditioner combined together with vitamin liquid make for one of the most highest quality hair conditioners that are commercially available. One must combine together all three of these travel size hair conditioners and then mix in the liquid multi-vitamin into this combination, shake and then allow to settle into the mix. Once correctly mixed together one would saturate all of the hair on the head with this combination of hair conditioner for up to 24 hours once every 2 weeks to completely restore the strength and the moisture to the hair. All split-ends on the hair will be healed within the 24 hours of this saturation. Eating x1 half bulb of fresh and raw garlic with purified drinking water every day for up to 6 months will clean the entire cardiovascular system in the human body and this will result in almost super-human blood flow to the head of the body.

This proceedure is the same as a professional tooth cleaning from a licensed dentist.

This process combined with manually scraping each individual tooth on the top, the sides and the back of each individual tooth with the DenTek &trade; Tooth Cleaning Kit will keep the teeth stronger and whiter than 98% of the world population.

Regular Internal Pheresis of the entire Cardiovascular system by a licensed medical doctor includes: xAmount of Millilters of Saline, xAmount of Milliliters of Liquid Multi-Vitamin, xAmount of Milliliters of Liquid Anti-Viral, xAmount of Milliliters of Liquid Anti-Bacterial, xAmount of Milliliters of Liquid Anti-Fungal, xAmount of Milliliters of Liquid Anti-Microbial and xAmount of Milliliters of Liquid Anti-Parasitic delivered intraveinously in xAmount of times within a 30 day time length.
In a ~160 Pounds // ~72.5748 Kilo-Grams human being there exists and circulates ~1.5 gallons of blood and 55% of that ~1.5 gallons of blood is made up of white blood, sugars, proteins and other things that are accumulated together by whatever is eaten by that human being over the previous 6 months. When a human being eats food the food is clumped together into a ball where then that ball of food is sent down to the intestinal system.. it is the intestins that literally suck out all of the nutrition out of the food and then circulates that nutrition to the blood system where that nutrition is then circulated to all of the organs in the human body to give each organ energy and strength. Never eat any food that has any amount of grease in it and never eat any food with pig or boar animal products in it. By regularly cleansing the Cardiovascular System through Pheresis over a 6 month time length using these factors will permanently restore the health, the beauty, the physique and the nutrition to the entire human body over a 6 month time length. During this 6 month time length the body will cut weight until it is left with only the real muscle around the bones as it burns up 75% of the stored fat around it, but after the 7th month the body will start getting massive muscle gains as this mix bonds to the body and to the cells internally so long as the diet is good. Combine this system with eating x1 full bulb of garlic every day for 365 days to destroy all blood clots, cholesterol clumps, greases and all other things from the Cardiovascular System and this will result in super-human blood flow and super-human nutrition circulation throughout the entire body. The mind will also achieve excellent mental clarity from this process.

<B>Example: Hand Washing Clothing :: Pants</B><BR>
<B>Notes</B>: By hand washing the clothing with the high pressure Concentrated Lava Rock Pumice Stone along with the Custom-Made Special Bar of Soap the traveler and backpacker can keep their clothing exceptionally clean. This hand washing combination and scrubbing technique will get the clothing more clean than what the automatic highest grade commercially available clothing washer can get the clothing clean.
One must soak wet each piece of clothing and then apply the Custom-Made Special Bar of Soap to each piece of clothing and let each piece of clothing sit in this solution for 10 - 15 minutes to allow the anti-microbial, anti-virual, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties to soak into the clothing material. For harder to remove bacteria and mites let each piece of clothing sit in a jug of water with 1 bottle of 60% Isopropyl Alcohol or greater percentage for 15 - 30 minutes after having applied the Custom-Made Special Bar of Soap lather to each piece of clothing. Once after the clothing has let sit in this soap lather for 10 - 15 minutes one must then hand scrub part by part the pants, the shirt, the socks, the underwear and any other piece of clothing. One must then thoroughly rinse with water each piece of clothing and then hand wring out each piece of clothing and allow the clothing to air dry in the sun with direct sun light. Hot and Dry Desert Weather Conditions with 90 Degrees Farenheit temperatures and greater will dry the clothing completely in approximately 30 minutes. One must fold the pants and the shirts and press them with the hands and smooth out the fabric after approximately 15 minutes into the drying session, but while the clothing is in between completely dry and not completely dry. This will leave the pants and the shirts looking professionally pressed once completely dry.<BR><BR>
